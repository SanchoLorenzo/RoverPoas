These files provide technical diagrams outlining the communication, hardware architecture, and operational control of a remote-controlled rover. 
The diagrams include various components like Arduino UNO, Raspberry Pi, radio communication modules, and control signals for motors and sensors. 
The system integrates bidirectional wireless communication between the rover and a central operations unit, allowing remote access and control over 
the roverâ€™s movement and data collection (e.g., CO2 levels, temperature, irradiance). These documents represent key aspects of the project, 
focusing on the hardware setup and connections necessary for the rover's operations over long distances.
